User's Guide<br>
0 GENERAL<br>
There're 3 lists in SMSNinja, including Privatelist, Whitelist and Blacklist. <font color="red">The priorities of them are Privatelist > Whitelist > Blacklist</font>, meaning messages and calls will be <mark>FILTER</mark>ED/<mark>BLOCK</mark>ED in this way: If the caller/sender is in Privatelist, he's <mark>FILTER</mark>ED by Privatelist; Otherwise he's checked by Whitelist, if he's in Whitelist, SMSNinja lets him go; Else SMSNinja sees whether he's in Blacklist to decide if he should be <mark>BLOCK</mark>ED. <font color="red">All entries' priorities inside the 3 lists decrease from top to bottom</font>, once a message or call matches one of the entries, the <mark>FILTER</mark>ing/<mark>BLOCK</mark>ing process stops right at that point. I'll use <mark>FILTER</mark> on Privatelist and <mark>BLOCK</mark> on Blacklist in the following text, please pay attention. Read through this page before you ask a question online. If you're interested to help translate SMSNinja into your native language, please let me know and your name will be listed here :)<br><br>

P.S. Play with SMSNinja for a while to get familiar with it, I've already tried my best to make everything simple and clear :P<br><br>

1 "SMSNinja" page<br>
1.1<br>
A complete SMSNinja shows 4 rows in this page, which are "SMSNinja", "Blocked Info", "Black & Whitelist" and "Private Zone". A fake SMSNinja shows 3 rows, without "Private Zone".<br><br>

2 "Settings" page<br>
2.1<br>
If you fill in "Password", you will be asked to enter this password each time you launch SMSNinja.<br><br>

2.2<br>
Dial "Launch Code" in MobilePhone will launch SMSNinja.<br><br>

2.3<br>
If you turn on "Icon/Statusbar badge", a pair of numbers will be shown on icon/statusbar, representing "Unread Calls Counts, Unread Messages Counts" in "Blocked Info".<br><br>

2.4<br>
If you turn on "Clear blocked calls", <mark>BLOCK</mark>ED call history will be deleted from MobilePhone's "Recents" view.<br><br>

3 "Blocked Info" page<br>
3.1<br>
In "SMS" page, unread messages are colored blue, while others are colored black. There'll be a round button at the end of the row if that message contains images, tap the button to view them. An asterisk (*) will be added at the end of numbers that are <mark>BLOCK</mark>ED by "Whitelist only", and the lower left pointed arrow on the right side of time stands for "incoming message". The same rules apply to "Call" page.<br><br>

4 "Black & Whitelist" page<br>
4.1<br>
Asterisk (*) as wildcards are supported in Black/Whitelist: "12345*" (without the quotation marks) for numbers with a prefix of "12345"; "*12345" for numbers with a suffix of "12345"; "*12345*" for numbers containing "12345".<br><br>

4.2<br>
You can add several numbers/keywords at once, using space ( ) as the separator. For example, "1 2 3" (without the quotation marks) turns to "1", "2", "3".<br><br>

4.3<br>
With a keyword "pear", messages containing "p*ear", "(pear]" and words like this will also be <mark>FILTER</mark>ED/<mark>BLOCK</mark>ED.<br><br>

5 "Private Zone" page<br>
5.1<br>
If you fill in both "FakePW" and "Password" (in "Settings" page), a fake SMSNinja is presented when you enter "FakePW" at launch. And "Password" in "Settings" page is redirected to "FakePW" implicitly.<br><br>

5.2<br>
If you toggle on "Thunder", a thunder logo will be added to the statusbar when there's unread private info. Once you go the "Private Info" page, the thunder disappears.<br><br>

5.3<br>
If you toggle on "Show Semicolon", the badge of SMSNinja will use semicolon instead of comma, i.e. "6;6" not "6,6", when there's unread private info. Once you go the "Private Info" page, semicolon will be replace by comma again.<br><br>

6 "Private Info" page<br>
6.1<br>
In "SMS" page, the lower left/upper right pointed arrow on the right side of time stands for "incoming/outgoing SMS". Other rules are the same to "Blocked Info" page.<br><br>

7. "Privatelist" page<br>
7.1<br>
<font color="red">Since the moment</font> you add a person into Privatelist, <font color="red">all communication logs between you two will be deleted from stock applications and saved only in Private Zone</font>. Other rules are the same to "Black & Whitelist" page.<br><br>

8 Customization<br>
8.1 The beeps of Black/Whitelist and Privatelist are located in "/var/mobile/Library/SMSNinja/blocked.caf" and "/var/mobile/Library/SMSNinja/private.caf". Replace them with other caf files (System caf files are under "/System/Library/Audio/UISounds/") and restart your SpringBoard.<br><br>

8.2<br>
Data files of SMSNinja are stored in "/var/mobile/Library/SMSNinja/". Make a backup of these files before reinstallation, <font color="red">authorize read/write permissions to them</font> (using iFile or something alike) and then put them back afterwards.<br><br>
